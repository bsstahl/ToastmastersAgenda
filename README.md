# ToastmastersAgenda

## A C#/.NET Core project for generating agendas for Toastmasters meetings.

Our Toastmasters club was getting tired of manually editing word documents every week to create our agendas. The process was very error-prone and required each Toastmaster to manually figure-out the timings for the meeting.

This project seeks to simplify and standardize the process by creating a website that a toastmaster can use to generate their agenda. Timings are automatically modified to handle single vs. multiple speeches, as well as variations in other activities.

We started by satisfying the needs of our club, but we want to make this available as simply as possible for everyone to use. As a result, we want to avoid logins if possible and having to store any data on the server.  We have accomplished this by storing all user data in browser cookies. Thus, any configuration added by the user is unique to that user and not shared. Config files can be downloaded and shared among club members, but each member will have to upload the configuration file once prior to use.  This also means that we do not store any personally identifiable information and do not track users in any way (other than standard web server logs) so there are no GDPR or other privacy issues to be concerned about.

It should be noted that there is at least one other agenda builder for Toastmasters out there, but it required the club to host the club website under their hosting umbrella, which didn't work for us. If you also need a place to host your club website, FreeToastHost or some equivalent may be a better choice for your club.

## Project Structure

### Common library
The *.Net Standard 2.0* library found at **/src/Toastmasters.Agenda/** holds the common elements of the project.  This includes Builders, Entities, Extension Methods & Interfaces that are used in other projects.

### Agenda Generator
The *.Net Standard 2.0* library found at **/src/Toastmasters.Agenda.Generator.Html/** holds an implementation of the *Toastmasters.Agenda.Interfaces.IAgendaGenerator* interface. This implementation creates the agenda in an HTML5 compliant document.  The document is completely self contained. That is, all style, content and images are stored inside the file so that it can easily be passed around, simply by sending the resulting file to another user.

### Website
The project website can be found under **src/Toastmasters.Web**. It is an ASP.NET Core MVC site that collects the required data and then utilizes the *Toastmasters.Agenda.Generator.Html.Engine* to generate and present the agenda.  This project also allows the user to modify configuration information to be stored in the user's web browser.

### Tools
There are currently 2 tools projects in the repository:

1) Agenda - A .NET Core executable that can generate agendas locally using the specified *IAgendaGenerator* implementation. This is mostly used for local testing.

1) CreateConfig - A .NET Core executable that can generate configuration files locally. This should no longer be needed since the configuration aspects of the website have been built out and are functional.

## Feature Requests

Please feel free to add your feature requests to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/bsstahl/ToastmastersAgenda/issues). We'll do what we can to make this valuable for all Toastmasters clubs.
